# q_learning_project
## Implementation Plan

### Team Members (github/cnet):
RD Babiera (rdbabiera), Diogo Viveiros(diogoviveiros)

### Questions (1-2 sentences on implementation, 1-2 sentences on testing)
1. Q-Learning Algorithm
- Executing the Q-Learning Algorithm

- Determining when the Q-Matrix has converged

- Once the Q-Matrix has converged, how how to determine which actions the robot 
should take to maximize expected reward

2. Robot Perception
- Determining the identities and locations of the three colored objects

- Determining the identities and locations of the three AR tags

3. Robot Manipulation & Movement
- Picking up and putting down the colored objects with the OpenMANIPULATOR arm

- Navigating to the appropriate locations to pick up and put down the colored 
objects

### Objectives

### High Level Description
#TODO 

### Q-Learning Algorithm
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
Q-learning algorithm in 1-3 sentences, and also describe what functions / 
sections of the code executed each of these components (1-3 sentences per 
function / portion of code): 

1. Selecting and executing actions for the robot (or phantom robot) to take

2. Updating the Q-Matrix

3. Determining when to stop iterating through the Q-learning algorithm

4. Executing the path most likely to lead to receiving a reward after the 
Q-matrix has converged on the simulated Turtlebot3 robot

### Robot Perspective
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
perception elements of this project in 1-3 sentences, any online sources of 
information/code that helped you to recognize the objects, and also describe what 
functions / sections of the code executed each of these components (1-3 sentences 
per function / portion of code): 

1. Identifying the locations and identities of each of the colored objects

2. Identifying the locations and identities of each of the AR tags

### Robot Manipulation and Movement
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
robot manipulation and movement elements of this project in 1-3 sentences, and 
also describe what functions / sections of the code executed each of these 
components (1-3 sentences per function / portion of code): 

1. Moving to the right spot in order to pick up a colored object

2. Picking up the colored object

3. Moving to the desired destination (AR tag) with the colored object

4. Putting the colored object back down at the desired destination
