### Q-Learning Algorithm
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
Q-learning algorithm in 1-3 sentences, and also describe what functions / 
sections of the code executed each of these components (1-3 sentences per 
function / portion of code): 

1. Selecting and executing actions for the robot (or phantom robot) to take

a

2. Updating the Q-Matrix

a

3. Determining when to stop iterating through the Q-learning algorithm

a

4. Executing the path most likely to lead to receiving a reward after the 
Q-matrix has converged on the simulated Turtlebot3 robot

### Robot Perspective
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
perception elements of this project in 1-3 sentences, any online sources of 
information/code that helped you to recognize the objects, and also describe what 
functions / sections of the code executed each of these components (1-3 sentences 
per function / portion of code): 

1. Identifying the locations and identities of each of the colored objects

a

2. Identifying the locations and identities of each of the AR tags

a

### Robot Manipulation and Movement
#TODO - Describe how you accomplished each of the following components of the 
robot manipulation and movement elements of this project in 1-3 sentences, and 
also describe what functions / sections of the code executed each of these 
components (1-3 sentences per function / portion of code): 

1. Moving to the right spot in order to pick up a colored object

a

2. Picking up the colored object

a

3. Moving to the desired destination (AR tag) with the colored object

a

4. Putting the colored object back down at the desired destination
